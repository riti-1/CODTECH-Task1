A Hospital Management System (HMS) developed using Java on the NetBeans IDE is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline hospital operations and enhance patient care. This system integrates various functionalities to manage different aspects of a hospital, including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, pharmacy management, and staff administration.

**Key Features:**

1. **Patient Management:** The system allows for efficient patient registration, maintaining comprehensive records including medical history, demographic details, and insurance information. It enables quick retrieval of patient records for healthcare professionals, ensuring timely and accurate treatment.

2. **Appointment Scheduling:** Patients can book appointments online or through the hospital reception. The system manages scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of appointments, reducing waiting times and optimizing resource utilization.

3. **Medical Records:** It facilitates digital storage and management of medical records, including diagnostic reports, prescriptions, and treatment plans. Authorized personnel can securely access patient data, ensuring continuity of care.

4. **Billing and Finance:** HMS automates billing processes, generating invoices for services rendered, medications prescribed, and other charges. It integrates with financial systems for accurate accounting and facilitates insurance claims processing.

5. **Pharmacy Management:** The system maintains inventory levels of medications and medical supplies, automates stock replenishment, and tracks usage to prevent shortages. Pharmacists can manage prescriptions and dispense medications efficiently.

6. **Staff Management:** It includes features for managing healthcare professionals and support staff, such as scheduling shifts, tracking attendance, and maintaining personnel records. This ensures adequate staffing levels and efficient workforce management.

7. **Reporting and Analytics:** HMS generates reports on key metrics like patient admissions, discharge summaries, revenue, and resource utilization. These insights aid in strategic decision-making and improving operational efficiency.

**Technology Stack:**

Developed using Java, the system leverages the object-oriented programming paradigm for modularity and scalability. NetBeans IDE provides a robust development environment with features like code debugging, GUI design tools, and project management capabilities, facilitating rapid application development.
